<!-- SYSTEM:     Article Authoring DTD of the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!---->
<!-- PURPOSE:    DTD for creation of new journal articles -->
<!---->
<!-- The Article Authoring DTD is an application of -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Article Authoring Tag Set. -->
<!-- It is a subset of the Journal Archiving and -->
<!-- Interchange DTD that is optimized for the -->
<!-- authoring (or initial XML tagging) of journal -->
<!-- articles and some non-article material such as -->
<!-- product and book reviews. It describes both the -->
<!-- metadata for a journal article and the full -->
<!-- content of the article. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD was constructed using the modules in the -->
<!-- JATS DTD Suite. -->

<!-- Information (NCBI) -->
<!-- National Library of Medicine (NLM) -->
<!---->
<!-- CREATED FOR: -->
<!-- This DTD was created from the JATS DTD Suite. -->
<!-- Authors, digital archives, and publishers may -->
<!-- use the DTD as is for markup of journal -->
<!-- literature or related material for archiving -->
<!-- and transferring such material between archives -->
<!-- or create a custom XML DTD from the Suite for -->
<!-- these purposes. -->
<!---->
<!-- This DTD is in the public domain. An organization -->
<!-- that wishes to create its own DTD from the suite -->
<!-- may do so without permission from NLM. -->
<!---->
<!-- The suite has been set up to be extended using a -->
<!-- new DTD file and a new DTD-specific customization -->
<!-- module to redefine the many Parameter Entities. -->
<!-- Do not modify the suite directly or redistribute -->
<!-- modified versions of the suite. -->
<!---->
<!-- In the interest of maintaining consistency and -->
<!-- clarity for potential users, NLM requests: -->
<!---->
<!-- 1. If you create a DTD from the JATS DTD Suite -->
<!-- and intend to stay compatible with the suite, -->
<!-- then please include the following statement -->
<!-- as a comment in all of your DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Created from, and fully compatible with, -->
<!-- the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article Tag -->
<!-- Suite (JATS)." -->
<!---->
<!-- 2. If you alter one or more modules of the suite, -->
<!-- then please rename your version and all its -->
<!-- modules to avoid any confusion with the -->
<!-- original suite. Also, please include the -->
<!-- following statement as a comment in all your -->
<!-- DTD modules: -->
<!-- "Based in part on, but not fully compatible -->
<!-- with, the ANSI/NISO Z39.96 Journal Article -->
<!-- Tag Suite (JATS)." -->

       modules and the catalogs.
  
   18. xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation added to attribute list of
       <article>. Most modern processors do not need this, but

       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 
  
       NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
       suggestions from the NISO request forms.
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
   11. MATHML 3.0 - Created a new version of the Authoring DTD to
       take MathML 3.0 instead of MathML 2.0.
       Nothing else changed from regular Authoring DTD.
       Call to MathML setup module changed and added call to the
       specific MathML 3.0 modules.
  
   10. DTD Version - Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.1d1" and 
       the formal public identifier to the date: "v1.1d1 20130915//EN".
  
    9. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new module for Common (global)
       attributes: %JATS-common-atts.ent;, called in before the
       customizations models module.
  
    8. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
           %jats-common-atts;
       to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
       @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
       whether metadata or narrative.
       Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
       parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
       The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
       entity.
       This added a new attribute list to:
        - back
        - body
        - front
  
       =============================================================
       NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
  
       ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 
  
       Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
       XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
  
    7. Fixed content models that were stated as "P*" and "sec*"
       to use the %just-para.class; and %sec.class; classes. 
       Element models that were changed include:
        - back
  
       =============================================================
       Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
  
       This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
       The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
       Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
       becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
       have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
       "Version 0.4".
  
       Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
  
    6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
  
    5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
       modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
       and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
       new version number "0".
             http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.
  
    4. XML:LANG - Added @xml:lang to the following elements:
       Added to facilitate multiple languages.
         - article
  
    3. LANGUAGE CODES - Codes for languages as well as variants,
       transliterations, regions, scripts, and combinations
       such as "Jpan"(Han + Hiragana + Katakana). These values should be
       taken from RFC 5646/W3C/IANA Subtag Registry recommendations
       and can be found online at:
         http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry
  
       =============================================================
       Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)
  
       Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
       In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
       elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
       to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
       All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
       web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.
  
       Details on version 3.0 are available at
             http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
  
    2. Changed default @xml:lang from "EN" from "en" to match latest
       RFC 4646/W3C/IANA Subtag Registry recommendations
  
    1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20071031//EN"

<!-- DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
  MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
  A set of journal archiving and interchange
  DTD modules was written as the basis for
  article creation, publishing, interchange,
  and repository DTDs, with the intention that
  DTDs for specific purposes, such as this
  Authoring  DTD, would be developed based on
  them.
  
  This Authoring DTD has been optimized for
  the creation of new journal articles by
  individual authors. This means that it lacks
  all the journal-related material (such as
  the journal metadata) that are not the
  responsibility of the author but of the
  publisher. This DTD is also smaller (fewer
  elements and fewer choices in many contexts)
  than either the Publishing or Archiving DTDs.
  It was not the intention to limit the
  expressive power licensed by the DTD, but
  rather to limit the many paths where there
  are several ways to tag the same material,
  where an archiving or publishing DTD needs to
  be able to accept all styles.

     This DTD then selects from those
  modules by referencing the external
  Parameter Entities defined in the Module of
  Modules. To include a set of elements (such
  as all the lists or the table elements) this
  DTD references the external Parameter Entity
  of the module that contains the declarations.
